Some notes:
So this was a school project that I did in a month while learning graphics programming in directx. It has billboarded clouds created through a graphics shader, dynamically tesselated mountains, full point, spot, and directional lighting. It also contains heightmapped terrain (the mountain) and a skybox.
I also encourage you to check out office mode just for fun. It transforms every texture (including the one used to heightmap the mountain) into michael scott's face. Enjoy and if you have any questions, my contact info is:
